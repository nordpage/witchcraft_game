name="Claude 3.5 Sonnet Chat API"
description="This facilitates a basic chat interface with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet API. I have found Claude to be the best AI available for gdscript and godot shaders, but available tools are limited. An API key is required (and API keys require funding a wallet). Your API key must be set in the project settings. Visit https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys for a key."
